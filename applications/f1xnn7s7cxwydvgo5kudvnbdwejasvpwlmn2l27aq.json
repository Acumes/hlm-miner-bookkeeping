    "Brief history of your project and organization": "The USGS leads U.S. mineral resource mapping and supply chain analysis for economic and national security, assessing global risks, domestic/defense needs, and future production. It partners with states, companies, universities, and agencies to find new resources in ground, mine tailings, and energy wastes. ACOLITE (v20221114.0) uses DSF algorithm to produce unitless aquatic reflectance: the ratio of water-leaving radiance to downwelling irradiance, multiplied by π.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "aws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://usgs-wma-sentinel-2-aqr-acolite-dsf/version_01/   272.4 TiB\n\nAquatic reflectance produced with the dark spectrum fitting (DSF) algorithm as implemented in the Atmospheric Correction for OLI “lite” (ACOLITE) software (version 20221114.0). Aquatic reflectance is defined here as unitless water-leaving radiance reflectance and represents the ratio of water-leaving radiance (units of watts per square meter per steradian per nanometer) to downwelling irradiance (units of watts per square meter per nanometer) multiplied by pi.",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "We will first download the data from AWS and store it on our hard drives. We use our in-house tools to pack CAR files. In the future, we will primarily deliver data to storage service providers via network transmission and by mailing hard drives.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "aws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://usgs-wma-sentinel-2-aqr-acolite-dsf/version_01/ \nhttps://registry.opendata.aws/usgs_aqr/",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[x] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Yearly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "1 to 1.5 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Asia other than Greater China, North America, Greater China",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "HTTP or FTP server, Shipping hard drives",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f02827565  Vietnam  \nf02826715  United States  \nf02825420  Taiwan  \nf03663680  Hong Kong  \nf03663684  Hong Kong\nf03624256  Hong Kong",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
