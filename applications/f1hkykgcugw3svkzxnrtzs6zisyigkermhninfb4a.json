    "Brief history of your project and organization": "4072\tNIFS Large Helical Device (LHD) Experiment\ts3://nifs-lhd\t0\t1.6P\n\n\nThe Large Helical Device (LHD), owned and operated by the National Institute for Fusion Science (NIFS), is one of the world's largest plasma confinement device which employs a heliotron magnetic configuration generated by the superconducting coils. The objectives are to conduct academic research on the confinement of steady-state, high-temperature, high-density plasmas, core plasma physics, and fusion reactor engineering, which are necessary to develop future fusion reactors. All the archived data of the LHD plasma diagnostics are available since the beginning of the LHD experiment, started on 31st of March, 1998.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "Experimental data from the Large Helical Device (LHD) are available at the LHD Data Repository of the National Institute for Fusion Science (NIFS) of the National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS).\n\nhttps://www-lhd.nifs.ac.jp/pub/Repository_en.html",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "1.Calculate size\n\naws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://unidata-nexrad-level2/ --recursive --human-readable --summarize\n\n2.Download data to local storage cluster using a private network\n\naws s3 cp --no-sign-request --recursive s3://nifs-lhd/ /local/storage/\n\n3.  Pack CAR file use graphsplit\nhttps://github.com/filedrive-team/go-graphsplit\n\n4. Set up a service to download CAR files",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "https://nifs-lhd.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html\n\nResources on AWS\nDescription\nLHD Diagnostic data\nResource type\nS3 Bucket\nAmazon Resource Name (ARN)\narn:aws:s3:::nifs-lhd\nAWS Region\nap-northeast-1\nAWS CLI Access (No AWS account required)\naws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://nifs-lhd",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[x] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Yearly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "1 to 1.5 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Greater China, Asia other than Greater China, North America",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "HTTP or FTP server",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f03645883 Seoul\nf03645884 Seoul\nf03644142 Hong Kong\nf03645007 Hong Kong\nf03645885 Tokyo",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
